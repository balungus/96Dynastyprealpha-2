Since then, however, both foreign and domestic problems have grown, with tensions rising in Eastern Europe and terrorism on American soil striking fear in the hearts of many. This, paired with general malaise, has produced a Republican ticket nobody but one man wanted.</br><br>Across the aisle, the Democratic Party experienced an almighty scramble in the primaries. Emerging from this battle is Governor Mario Cuomo of New York. Long considered a strong potential candidate, it would seem the party is ready to give liberalism one final attempt after four consecutive losses on the presidential level. Cuomo's first challenge is to unite his party, and given the polling, that should be the only challenge, even despite rumblings of another Ross Perot candidacy this fall.",

During his time in Albany, he has declined the opportunity to run for president twice before, first in 1988 and again in 1992, despite draft movements for his candidacy. Now, it would seem that Cuomo is finally prepared to shed his \"Hamlet on the Hudson\" moniker, and given his opponent, he's practically got a free ticket to the White House.</br><br>Touting his record as governor and popularity among the party base, Cuomo dispatched most of his primary opponents with ease. There is some concern that his liberalism will be a detriment in Southern states that went for Clinton four years ago, and further concern regarding stances such as his staunch opposition to capital punishment, which may prove unpopular in the high-crime environment. However, with the unpopularity of  Quayle and the potential for Ross Perot to enter the race, nearly every state seems to be in play for the Cuomo campaign this fall. So long as no serious scandals or gaffes occur, Cuomo seems set to become the first Italian-American president.",

Trailing heavily in the polls and facing another potential Ross Perot third-party challenge, which some say almost sunk Bush's campaign in '92, the situation looks dire for the vice president. Despite this, Quayle remains confident in himself if nothing else, confident that he can make four victories in a row become five by winning a term of his own. Stranger victories have happened, but with how the polling is looking, most Republicans aren't holding their breath.",

This belief is also held across the aisle, with Democrats giddy at the thought of another strong third-party performance as the icing on the cake to Dan Quayle's nomination.
